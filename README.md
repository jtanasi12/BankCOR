# BankCOR

Our banking system provides users with the flexibility to manage multiple checking/savings accounts and credit accounts. The CheckProcessors method, invoked when a customer needs to make a deduction and settle a check, allows users to specify the order of deduction from their accounts. If the cumulative amount is unavailable across all accounts, the system gracefully handles the situation by throwing an exception, ensuring no funds are deducted. This banking application leverages the console window to exemplify the implementation of the Chain oF Responsibility design pattern in Java, while also highlighting the utilization of exception propagation. Thank you, enjoy!
